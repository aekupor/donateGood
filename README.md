## Overview
### Description
A marketplace where all proceeds are donated to charities. 

Sellers will offer their services (ACT tutoring, teaching a language, etc.) or products (custom art, homemade jewelry, etc.) for a price and will either specify which charity all proceeds will be directed to or will leave it up to the choice of the buyer.

Buyers will buy services or products from the sellers and all proceed money will be directed to a charity. They will receive something in return for their donation.
